Hello. funcore here is a repository for restafund front-end SSR.

Invest more, get more. We will build this web like build house for our family.

# Team Reminders

- Its OK to get angry and say stupid shit. Don’t be a permanent asshole
- Think about what you actually want (and why you want it)
- We all have something to teach. We all have something to learn
- Try not to leave work angry. Work it out if you can
- Cutting corners is almost never worth it. Don’t leave booby traps
- Outcomes over output. Impact over quantity and speed.
- If we were all replicas of each other, work would be really boring
- Take care of yourself! Eat well. Stay home when you’re sick. Pace yourself
- Whenever possible, show don’t tell. Specificity beats platitudes
- Respect each other’s time, and respect each other’s energy
- Sometimes we all get together and work in the same room (referred to as “meetings”)
- If we’re not proud of our work, something is wrong. Speak up!
- Discipline, responsibility, and accountability are part of the craft. Make sure these words don’t get abused and polluted
- Before thinking "more process" check for trust
- Laugh and have fun. We’re making stuff! How cool is that?
